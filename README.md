# IOT Based Predictive Prosthetic Controls

**Data Collection:** The system collects data from a gyroscope sensor placed on the shoulder. 
The gyroscope measures the orientation of the shoulder in terms of pitch, roll, and yaw 
angles. These angles provide information about the movement and orientation of the 
shoulder.

**Data Analysis:** Using data analytics techniques, the system analyzes the collected data to 
identify patterns and correlations between shoulder orientation, grip patterns, and 
performance metrics. Machine learning algorithms could be employed to recognize these 
patterns and predict which grip pattern would be most effective for a given task.
