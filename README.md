# IOT Based Predictive Prosthetic Controls

**Data Collection:** The system collects data from a gyroscope sensor placed on the shoulder. 
The gyroscope measures the orientation of the shoulder in terms of pitch, roll, and yaw 
angles. These angles provide information about the movement and orientation of the 
shoulder, which can be correlated with different grip patterns.

**User Interaction Data:** As the user interacts with the prosthetic arm, the gyroscope 
continuously captures data on the shoulder's orientation. This data, combined with 
timestamps, provides a detailed record of how the user moves their shoulder during various 
activities.

**Performance Metrics:** The system also collects performance metrics related to the use of 
different grip patterns. This could include factors like the speed and accuracy of movements, 
the force exerted on objects, and the user's comfort level with each grip.

**Data Analysis:** Using data analytics techniques, the system analyzes the collected data to 
identify patterns and correlations between shoulder orientation, grip patterns, and 
performance metrics. Machine learning algorithms could be employed to recognize these 
patterns and predict which grip pattern would be most effective for a given task.
